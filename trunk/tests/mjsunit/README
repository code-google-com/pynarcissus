These tests came from the V8 javascript engine codebase. They have been
ever-so-slightly modified, as a few of them were originally using %-symbols as
parts of function names, and object getters and setters, which PyNarcissus is
not supporting.

The point of these tests is to simply compare the parse tree output of the
original Narcissus with that of PyNarcissus.
