PyNarcissus is currently just a Javascript parser, and not a very Pythonic one
at that. Furthermore, documentation is poor.

As of 2009-02-19, PyNarcissus has been engineered such that

str(parse("javascript code"))

in Python is identical to

parse("javascript code").toString()

in Javascript. It was this feature that allowed for robust testing of the
parser in the absence of a Javascript evaluator, as the output of the Python
version was compared to the output of the Javascript version over all of the
Spidermonkey Javascript tests.

There are a few differences in output, as Python handles both floating point
precision and non-ascii characters slightly differently.

It is expected that future versions of PyNarcissus will be more Pythonic in many
ways, and will break this string-conversion compatibility with the Javascript
Narcissus.
